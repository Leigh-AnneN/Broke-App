1. Removed the let and var keywords when declaring app and axios. 
2. Imported the express module using const instead of let. 
3. Removed the unnecessary next parameter in the route handler function since it was not being used.
4. Updated the route handler to use async/await syntax for making multiple API requests using axios.get.
5. Changed the try-catch block to properly catch errors and send them to the error-handling middleware.
6. Replaced res.send with res.json to send the response in JSON format.
7. Removed the unnecessary app.listen(3000) at the end since it's already being exported in the module.
